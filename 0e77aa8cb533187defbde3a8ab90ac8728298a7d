IMHO this code is broken on multi-host platforms anyway, so it cannot be a consistent feature to begin with.\n\nYes, actually this FRU ID 0 to specific FRU EEPROM mapping does not support multi-hots platform.\n\n\u003e I am thinking, we could check to see if there are other decorators to confirm if this is indeed our server platform?\n\nI saw Yv4 has added SlotNumber, probally multi-host platform can use this property to find correct FRU EEPROM bus and address.\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/entity-manager/blob/master/configurations/yosemite4_sentineldome_t1.json#L360-L362\n\nHowever, Catalina is a single-host system with two MB module, it a different case compare to Harma (single-host) \u0026 Yv4 (multi-host).\n\nCould we use this patch as a quick fix for single-host platform?",
