      "message": "We really should not be opening EEPROMs directly.  I don\u0027t think I want to see this behavior expanded.\n\n1. We are trying to get approval to remove the get/set GUID function.  There seems to be no production use case for it as far as I\u0027ve heard from RTP.  Do you know of a use case?\n\n2. We should be relying on the entity-manager / fru-manager parsing of the EEPROM directly rather than secondarily doing our own parsing of the EEPROM.\n\n3. Rather than yet-another configuration file, if we do need to do this work, we should be able to figure the appropriate EEPROM from the entity-manager information.",
