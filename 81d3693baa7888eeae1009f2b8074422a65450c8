      "message": "I\u0027m slightly surprised this works.  What does this look like when there are multiple instances?  We have an int 0 in one case and a string \"1 2 3 4\" in another case?  How is that possible?\n\nI see throughout the code you are now doing comparisons against 0.  If hostInstances is a string, doesn\u0027t this become effectively a comparison against NULL?  I\u0027m surprised we didn\u0027t get compiler warnings for using an integer for pointer comparison.  Even without a compiler warning, I think we should do something to clean this up because it is non-obvious.",
