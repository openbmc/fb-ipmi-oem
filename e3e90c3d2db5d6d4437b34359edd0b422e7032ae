I\u0027ve mentioned this on an earlier review at the place this function is called:\n\n\u003e With your current implementation, you cannot have this condition.\n\u003e The proposal I made throws instead on error.  You might need to change this to a catch.  Alternatively you could use a std::optional return from your findHost function (instead of throwing).",
