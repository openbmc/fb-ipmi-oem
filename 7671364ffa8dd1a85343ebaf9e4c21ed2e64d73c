      "message": "Technically, isn\u0027t some of the DIMM information available when data.push_back(result) is executed above?  Thus, it would be good to report some DIMM data is available if at least some of the DIMM data has been processed prior to an exception as opposed to logging an error that DIMM information not available.  Thus, if an error occurred on say the 3rd or 4th DIMM, it would still be helpful to attempt to continue for other DIMMs and report just the DIMM that caused the failure as having no DIMM information available.",
